I'm weight training for aesthtics with push, pull, legs, then break day. 
I will train Muay Thai with nico on my break days.

I will need to communicate with my trainer in order to work out a schedule with him for Muay Thai training. 
I will also need to communicate with my friends on the weekend to take advantage of their gym memberships 
so that I dont have to go the one all the way down by my office.
